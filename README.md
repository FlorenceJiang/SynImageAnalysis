# synImageAnalysis

This is a library for comparing syn and real sattlelite images in the latent feature space. 



# Get Started

```
!git clone https://github.com/FlorenceJiang/synImageAnalysis

# install all the libraries
!pip install requirements.txt
```



# Usage

```
# go to the code section
cd code/
```

You could preprocess images (make tiles, crop bbox)

```

```

Also, you could make localization maps with detectron2 models.

There are two options: 1) spatial attention maps 2) averaged feature maps

```

```

You could also plot out the images together with those maps.

```

```
